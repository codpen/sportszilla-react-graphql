It's a web application where anybody can find a new sport buddy and sport events close to his/her area. The User has the possibility to create own event in every listed sport. Events are customizable, meaning you can create an event that best fits your needs. The app allows users to visualize events without the need of login. Events can be filtered by sport and date.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repo and clone your fork to your development environment

2. Navigate to the server folder and run `npm install` in your terminal to install dependencies. Then simply run `npm start` to get the backend running. You should be greeted with `server listening on `http://localhost:8000`

3. In a second terminal navigate to the client folder and run `npm install` in your terminal to install dependencies. Then simply run `npm start` to get the react frontend running. You should see the app open up in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` - the default react port.

4. The app is running :-)
